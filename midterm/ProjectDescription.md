# Dynamic Web - Midterm Project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate your understanding of the following things:

1. Querying Data
2. Using Data in a UI
3. UI changing based on the data changing
4. Applying these principles to a concept

These core concepts have been taught and discussed in the first three exercises and the lectures up to this point.

## Submitting the Project

Send James the Github link to your project and _a screenshot_ of the project. List the places where you meet the project requirements as well.

The project is due â€‹no later than _October 31st_

This date is critical because I need to submit your midterm grades on November 4th - without this project being done on _October 31st_, it would be impossible for me to grade it and submit your grade by then resulting in a poor Midterm grade. No late assignments - talk with me well ahead of time if you need any help or accommodations.

## Project Description

### Project Requirements:

1. Use two sources of data
2. Display the two sources of data in the same UI
3. Have the UI be interactive
4. Have the UI change based on the data
5. Have the site styled

### Two Sources of Data:

Ideally both sources of data are from a remote API. However, I understand how difficult it can be to find free APIs so you are allowed to create or find JSON data (similar to Exercise Two) to display the information.

### Display Both Sources of Data:

Your first thought might be to show the data in a table, however, there are many other ways to think about this project. Some ideas: a Wiki, a blog page, a faux marketplace, display of facts and numbers for a topic (environmental data, police statistics, economic data, etc.) in an informative way that is not just showing data, something completely different.

### Have the UI be Interactive:

The user should be able to click on elements in the UI and that will change the data that is displayed. Depending on the direction you take for the data display this should be a simple task but feel free to discuss with me for some ideas.

### Have the UI change based on the data

Similar to Exercise Three, having elements which change based on data. Color is just one option here. Think about size, layout, different elements, or anything that will change based on the data.

### Have the site styled

This should look as good as you can do. I suggest you consider a visual style before writing any code.

# Command Line Cheat Sheet (Mac)

_not an exhaustive list_

## Moving through the file system

### cd

`cd` is the primary command for navigating throughout your file system.

```js
# Go to the root of your file system
cd /

# Go to a place in the current folder you are in
cd ./

# Go UP a level in your file system
cd ../
```

### ls

`ls` allows you to view the files that are at your current place in your file system. This is useful if you need to check where you are or where you might want to go.

```js
# List all files/folders at your current location in the file system
ls
```

## Closing an active terminal process

Instead of just closing the terminal when you want to end a process, you can hit `ctrl + c` to end a process. This is useful for many of the node/npm processes we run.

# Social Media Site

## Practical Approach (more design thinking)

1. Three social media sites you use or are aware of:

   a. ...

   b. ...

   c. ...

2. Solving a problem (or pain point) - research

   a. What is the experience of your current social media sites?

3. Once you identify the problem, how do you solve it?

   a. What if you're not trying to solve a problem?

4. What is the solution? How does it solve the problem?

5. What are the features that solve this problem?

   a. Now that you've identified the problems you can make the project stand out.

## Abstract Approach (more artful)

1. What is a topic or series of topics you are interested in?
2. How does user interaction affect the influence of this topic?
3. What message are you trying to convey? Is there a message you are trying to convey or is this a design exercise?

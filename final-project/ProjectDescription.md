# Dynamic Web - Final Project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate your understanding of the following things:

1. Creating a web application
2. Creating an API
3. Get and Post data through the API
4. Creating users and authentication

These core concepts have been taught and discussed in the five exercises and the lectures (we will be covering some of the topics in the upcoming weeks).

## Submitting the Project

Send James the Github link to your project, a link to a deployed website, and a link to a deployed API. List the places where you meet the project requirements as well.

The project is due ​no later than December 12​.

No late assignments - talk with me well ahead of time if you need any help or accommodations.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to make a social media site. You will make a fully functioning social media site with users, posts, and styling. This means you will need:

1. Signup Page
2. User Profile Page
3. A Dashboard or Landing Page
4. A Way to Write a Post
5. Login Page
6. A Way to Let the User Sign Out
7. Any Other Things you May Need for Your Site

### Project Strategy:

If I were going to approach the project here is how I would go about it:

1. Setup a new Create React App and put it in a Github Repo
2. Setup a new Node/Express App and deploy it to Heroku
3. Connect Firebase to both the Node app and Create React App
4. Create the pages and components you will need (think about this, maybe sketch out some designs and consider the UX flow of the site) and the routes for the pages.
5. Do some slight layout styling and create forms
6. Create the Firebase data stores you will need
7. Create and Integrate Firebase authentication
8. Create the API calls you will need. Hint:

- Create User
- Get User Info
- Create Post
- Get Post
- Get All Posts
- Login (Firebase on client?)
- Logout (Firebase on client?)

8. Finish styling and test

### Have the site styled

This should look as good as you can do. I suggest you consider a visual style before writing any code.

# Exercise Two: Get Used to React and Showing Data

## Requirements:

1. Text Editor
2. NPM Installed
3. JSON File from Github Repo
4. Design Mockup

## Directions:

1. Create new Github Repository named "Dynamic Web Exercise Two"
2. Install Next.js and Create New Project

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

(note, you may have to install node. Google 'install node' to find the correct distribution for your operating system)

3. Init new Github repo inside of the new project

4. Create a `article` folder and then inside of a `[slug]` folder create a `page.js` file.

- Optional - clean out files you are not going to use

5. Move the data.json file into your app folder.

6. Create an article card component and then import and loop over JSON data to show article previews on the Article Listing page.

- Display image in card
- Display published date in card
- Display title in card
- Display blurb in card

7. Display full article on article page accessible by a route (for example, the article with the ID of 'article-one' is available at `/article/article-one`)

- Ensure all elements are present on the Article page.

8. Make sure the design of the exercise matches the provided designs with your own twist

9. Submit the link to the Github repo to James at ja155@nyu.edu or through Brightspace

# Exercise Four: Creating an API

The purpose of this exercise is to get used to getting and posting data to an API.

## Requirements:

1. Have a deployed Node app
2. Have a firebase database
3. Have a place to view data
4. Have a place to write data through a form

## Directions:

1. Create new Github Repository named "Dynamic Web Exercise Four"
2. Create and set up a new Node server (see Exercise 3)
3. Deploy the server to Heroku
4. Connect Firebase to the Node app
5. Create a schema in Firebase for blog posts (include title, text, and author)
6. Setup a query from Firebase for an individual article (based on ID)
7. Setup a query from Firebase for all articles
8. Setup a route for each article
9. Setup a route for all articles
10. Create an html form in a route that has an action which posts to your API
11. Submit the link to the Github repo AND the link to the deployed server to James at ja155@nyu.edu

## Useful Resources

_Note:_ Focus on "web" instead of Node for this project. Node will take you deeper into the Google Cloud Platform (which is more secure and scalable but outside of the scope for this exercise)
